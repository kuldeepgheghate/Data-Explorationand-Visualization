# Python Data Science Visualization Tools

For this assignment, you will explore in Python. The focus will be on using libraries like to create meaningful and insightful data visualizations. 
This task will help you gain hands-on experience in presenting data effectively.Instructions::
Create at least 3 different types of visualizations using datasets of your choice (or provided by the instructor).:

Matplotlib
Seaborn

# Diff Graphs

Line chart
Bar graph
Scatter plot
Heat map
histogram

# Data-Set

: Use open-source datasets from platforms like Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, or any public datasets.: Submit a Python notebook (.ipynb) file along with a brief report (PDF) explaining:
What the dataset represents.
The steps you took to clean and preprocess the data (if necessary).
How the visualizations represent the data clearly.
Insights drawn from your visualizations.
